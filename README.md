# GeoNotes
A simple app to create and manage georeferenced notes (text and photos) on a map. The goal is to create the notes as fast as possible without any unnecessary UI/UX overhead.

You want to report a bug, add a feature wish or maybe even add some code?
That great! Here's how to do so.

### Report feedback (no GitHub-account needed)

1. Open the GeoNotes app.
2. Go into the settings (upper right menu â†’ "Settings"/gear-icon) and click on the "Feedback" button at the bottom of the screen.

### Report bug / add feature request

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/hauke96/GeoNotes/issues/new).
2. Describe the bug/feature as clearly as possible. Maybe add some screenshots or drawings to clear things up.
3. Be open for questions and an discussion.

After a possible discussion, the bug will hopefully be fixed or the feature implemented.

### Contribute code

## Use-case and Philosophy

### Basic idea of this app

Take notes while being outside (maybe even while walking or sitting in a bus) and later add the data to e.g. OSM.

### Usability principles

To implement the above goal/idea, the app follows some basic principles:

* **Simplicity:** Make creating, editing, moving and deleting of notes as fast/easy as possible
* **No upload** of data and no creation of notes on osm.org
* **General purpose:** No restriction in the content of a note
* **Not a note management tool:** No import, no high level management operations
* **Simple and pragmatic UI:** No unnecessary animations, no overloaded UIs
* **Feature toggles:** The possibility to enable/disable features

### Features which will *not* be added to GeoNotes

* Offline maps: Too much work (where does the data come from? What format? When to update the data? Vector or raster data/tiles? etc.)
* Creating notes on osm.org
* Uploading data directly to OSM (there are [other apps](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) to do that)
* All sorts of features that will only be used by ~5% (meaning a very small amount) of the users
* iOS support

Try other apps like [StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) if you want to do one of the above things.
