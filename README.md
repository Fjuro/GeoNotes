# GeoNotes
A simple and lightweight app to create and manage georeferenced notes (text and photos) on a map. The goal is to create the notes as fast as possible without any unnecessary UI/UX overhead.

## Contribute to this project

You want to report a bug, add a feature wish or maybe even add some code?
That great :D Here's how to do so.

### Report feedback (no GitHub-account needed)

1. Open the GeoNotes app.
2. Go into the settings (upper right menu â†’ "Settings"/gear-icon) and click on the "Feedback" button at the bottom of the screen.

This will open your default E-Mail App on your phone so that you can now write me an E-Mail.

### Report bug / add feature request

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/hauke96/GeoNotes/issues/new).
2. Describe the bug/feature as clearly as possible. Maybe add some screenshots or drawings to clear things up.
3. Be open for questions and an discussion.

After a possible discussion, the bug will hopefully be fixed or the feature implemented.
Don't be sad if your feature won't make it. This is not my only project and I'm running this in my spare time, my resources are therefore quite limited ;) 

### Contribute code

Please create an issue before adding code (except it's just a spelling mistake or something similarly small).

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/hauke96/GeoNotes/issues/new).
2. Describe the changes you want to make as clearly as possible. Maybe add mock-ups/drawings, code snippets, diagrams, etc. to clear things up.
3. Be open for questions and an discussion.
4. When everything is clear, enjoy coding ;)

Don't be sad if I don't want your feature idea to be in GeoNotes.
This is my private project and I have a certain idea (s. below) what this app should be and what not.
But feel free to create a fork and develop your own version of this app :)

## Use-case and Philosophy

### Basic idea of this app

Take notes while being outside (maybe even while walking or sitting in a bus) and later add the data to e.g. OSM.

### Usability principles

To implement the above goal/idea, the app follows some basic principles:

* **Simplicity:** Make creating, editing, moving and deleting of notes as fast/easy as possible
* **No upload** of data and no creation of notes on osm.org
* **General purpose:** No restriction in the content of a note
* **Not a note management tool:** No import, no high level management operations
* **Simple and pragmatic UI:** No unnecessary animations, no overloaded UIs
* **Feature toggles:** The possibility to enable/disable features

### Features which will probably *not* be added to GeoNotes

* Offline maps (too much work for now)
* Creating notes on osm.org
* Uploading data directly to OSM (there are [other apps](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) to do that)
* All sorts of features that will only be used by just a few users but require a lot of work to be implemented
* iOS and other non-android support

Try other apps like [StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) if you want to do one of the above things.
